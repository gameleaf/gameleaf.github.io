# TODOs
- [ ] Continue working on markdown input to build a blog on Next.js https://dev.to/tinacms/creating-a-markdown-blog-with-next-js-52hk
- [ ] Integrate Stripe. Try to figure out a way to purchase a "lifetime membership" to GameLeaf learning games for $10. https://dev.to/stripe/type-safe-payments-with-next-js-typescript-and-stripe-4jo7
- [ ] Keypad Directions Console Log!
- [ ] Dynamic subsetting of the Source Han font makes it snap in, which is fugly. Preload the font characters somehow when we are starting up? Or just use the system font? https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-events.html
- [x] Fix the Home Page. Make it simple and work on iPhones, Androids, and Desktop.
- [x] Figure out how to fix the red box's margin-top such that it works for both wide pages and tall pages. The solution is to use @media queries with vmax (which is the viewport's longer side).
