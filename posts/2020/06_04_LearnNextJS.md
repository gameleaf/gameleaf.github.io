I have been comparing Next.js with GatsbyJS. Both are interesting! Next.js is definitely simpler to understand at the moment. I'm trying to decide if I should dump GatsbyJS, even though my Piano University website is built on GatsbyJS. My life would certainly be simpler if I didn't have to learn multiple things :-). However, I might become a better programmer if I learn both Next and Gatsby!
