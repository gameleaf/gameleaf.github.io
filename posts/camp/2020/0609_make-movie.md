# Make a Movie
When I was a teenager, a relative gifted me an old VHS camcorder. I used it for some school projects. My younger brother might remember me using it to make a silly "movie" about being in an earthquake.

These days, we have video recorders in our pockets. Imagine bringing a phone or tablet back to Dr. Emmett Brown's lab. Even in 1985, he would be shocked at the film making capabilities. ("No wonder your president has to be an actor.") Many apps would be useless. Don't forget your USB charger!

# Process
* Brainstorm ideas and pick your favorite.
* Sketch storyboards for the movie.
* Design a set by drawing the backdrop, or decorating an area with toys and household items.
* Film with toys as actors and do a voiceover for the script. Alternatively, have family members act out the parts.
* Edit in iMovie and publish to YouTube / Facebook.
