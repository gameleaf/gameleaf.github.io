Both kids are spending the summer at home, and I would like to make it a fun and fruitful summer for us all.\n\nOur two boys are 6.7 and 3.8 years old ðŸ˜Ž. The six-year-old starts first grade in August. I'd like to create projects that are fun for both kids. The activity should scale nicely. It should be challenging for the older child, but still understandable for the little one.\n\n# Ideas\n* **Make a Movie**\n* **Make a Video Game (or Animation)** I have some expertise here ðŸ¤“. I think it'll be fun for the boys to dream up a game and then make some progress towards building it. We will start with Scratch Jr. and see how far we can go with it.\n  * Little brother can help play test the game!\n* **Make a Board/Card Game**\n  * It would be fun to make up rules for a board game. We can also draw art or repurpose junk from around the house as game pieces.\n* **Play Piano** - Both kids enjoy music. So far, they like music from Star Wars, Disney/Pixar films, and video games.\n  * I have a 1/2 scale kids guitar, but guitar isn't quite as natural as piano (for a complete beginner). I can always try sticking to one string, and see if I can teach them how to play a simple melody.\n* **Sports** - I need to get the kids outside every day. Big brother is trying to learn how to inline skate. I'd like to teach little brother how to bike.\n  * Dribble a basketball.\n  * Hit a tennis ball against a wall.\n  * Throw a frisbee.\n* **Math**\n  * Play board games and card games that require point and counting.\n  * Take observations and measurements! Lots of fun possibilities:\n    * length of shadows\n    * circumference of a small tree\n    * count the number of birds we see during a walk around our neighborhood.\n* **Language**\n  * Both kids are great at speaking Mandarin. \n  * I'd like to get them to practice some Cantonese. We can find some songs and cartoons on YouTube.\n* **English**\n  * Teach the little guy how to read (and draw straight lines, which will help with writing capital letters).\n  * Big brother is a ravenous reader. I might try story time with more challenging material (e.g., Harry Potter). I can also find age appropriate e-books with fun pictures.\n* **Housework**\n  * Haha! How can we make chores fun? Maybe add a timer or a competitive aspect to tasks? \n\n# Fun & Rewards\nI made a simple spreadsheet to track our progress. If we spend 10 minutes on an item, it gets a check mark. The idea is to build up a chain so that we spend 10+ minutes on a project _every single day_. Every time we build up a chain of 5 days in a row, we get fun rewards like stickers, video game time, sweet desserts, etc.\n\nIn the end, I'd like to make the learning process as fun as possible!"},"__N_SSG":true}
